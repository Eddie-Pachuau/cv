    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I am the type of person who enjoys doing countless activities; 
        from music to sports, from movie-making to drawing, I enjoy almost anything that I feel will improve me while being enjoyable as well.
        Is a career in computer science really worth it?
        In 1995, during my final year at IIT Kanpur, TCS and Infosys gave job offers to more than 60% of my class. Even the guys who really struggled (the ‘5 point someone’ variety) and had no other job options, easily got software jobs. And it did not matter whether you studied civil engineering or chemical engineering. So what was the point of studying computer science?
        
        Soon enough, IT majors like TCS and Infosys started hiring lakhs from across all campuses across India, and I became even more convinced that software engineering was now a commodity. It was a ticket to a safe but mediocre career.</p>
